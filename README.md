This repository is for programs related to data acquisition, collection, parsing, and viewing.

It's also the **BEST** repository in the history of Polar Robotics!

If you are reading this, you probably already know why you are here and what you need. If not, refer to `Data Acquisition.md` under the `PR-Docs` repository.
